<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for train.py</span></summary>

  #### --source_path / -s
  Path to the source directory containing a COLMAP or Synthetic NeRF data set.
  #### --model_path / -m 
  Path where the trained model should be stored (```output/<random>``` by default).
  #### --images / -i
  Alternative subdirectory for COLMAP images (```images``` by default).
  #### --eval
  Add this flag to use a MipNeRF360-style training/test split for evaluation.
  #### --resolution / -r
  Specifies resolution of the loaded images before training. If provided ```1, 2, 4``` or ```8```, uses original, 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 resolution, respectively. For all other values, rescales the width to the given number while maintaining image aspect. **If not set and input image width exceeds 1.6K pixels, inputs are automatically rescaled to this target.**
  #### --data_device
  Specifies where to put the source image data, ```cuda``` by default, recommended to use ```cpu``` if training on large/high-resolution dataset, will reduce VRAM consumption, but slightly slow down training. Thanks to [HrsPythonix](https://github.com/HrsPythonix).
  #### --white_background / -w
  Add this flag to use white background instead of black (default), e.g., for evaluation of NeRF Synthetic dataset.
  #### --sh_degree
  Order of spherical harmonics to be used (no larger than 3). ```3``` by default.

  #### --convert_cov3D_python
  Flag to make pipeline compute forward and backward of the 3D covariance with PyTorch instead of ours.
  #### --debug
  Enables debug mode if you experience erros. If the rasterizer fails, a ```dump``` file is created that you may forward to us in an issue so we can take a look.
  #### --debug_from
  Debugging is **slow**. You may specify an iteration (starting from 0) after which the above debugging becomes active.
  #### --iterations

  #### --test_iterations
  Space-separated iterations at which the training script computes L1 and PSNR over test set, ```7000 30000``` by default.
  #### --save_iterations
  Space-separated iterations at which the training script saves the Gaussian model, ```7000 30000 <iterations>``` by default.
  #### --checkpoint_iterations
  Space-separated iterations at which to store a checkpoint for continuing later, saved in the model directory.
  #### --start_checkpoint
  Path to a saved checkpoint to continue training from.
  #### --quiet 
  Flag to omit any text written to standard out pipe. 
  #### --feature_lr
  Spherical harmonics features learning rate, ```0.0025``` by default.
  #### --opacity_lr
  Opacity learning rate, ```0.05``` by default.
  #### --scaling_lr
  Scaling learning rate, ```0.005``` by default.
  #### --rotation_lr
  Rotation learning rate, ```0.001``` by default.
  #### --position_lr_max_steps
  Number of steps (from 0) where position learning rate goes from ```initial``` to ```final```. ```30_000``` by default.
  #### --position_lr_init
  Initial 3D position learning rate, ```0.00016``` by default.
  #### --position_lr_final
  Final 3D position learning rate, ```0.0000016``` by default.
  #### --position_lr_delay_mult
  Position learning rate multiplier (cf. Plenoxels), ```0.01``` by default. 
  #### --densify_from_iter
  Iteration where densification starts, ```500``` by default. 
  #### --densify_until_iter
  Iteration where densification stops, ```15_000``` by default.
  #### --densify_grad_threshold
  Limit that decides if points should be densified based on 2D position gradient, ```0.0002``` by default.
  #### --densification_interval
  How frequently to densify, ```100``` (every 100 iterations) by default.
  #### --opacity_reset_interval
  How frequently to reset opacity, ```3_000``` by default. 
  #### --lambda_dssim
  Influence of SSIM on total loss from 0 to 1, ```0.2``` by default. 
  #### --percent_dense
  Percentage of scene extent (0--1) a point must exceed to be forcibly densified, ```0.01``` by default.

Note that similar to MipNeRF360, we target images at resolutions in the 1-1.6K pixel range. For convenience, arbitrary-size inputs can be passed and will be automatically resized if their width exceeds 1600 pixels. We recommend to keep this behavior, but you may force training to use your higher-resolution images by setting ```-r 1```.

The MipNeRF360 scenes are hosted by the paper authors [here](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/). You can find our SfM data sets for Tanks&Temples and Deep Blending [here](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/input/tandt_db.zip). If you do not provide an output model directory (```-m```), trained models are written to folders with randomized unique names inside the ```output``` directory. At this point, the trained models may be viewed with the real-time viewer (see further below).

### Evaluation
By default, the trained models use all available images in the dataset. To train them while withholding a test set for evaluation, use the ```--eval``` flag. This way, you can render training/test sets and produce error metrics as follows:
```shell
python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset> --eval # Train with train/test split
python render.py -m <path to trained model> # Generate renderings
python metrics.py -m <path to trained model> # Compute error metrics on renderings
```

<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Line Arguments for render.py</span></summary>

  #### --model_path / -m 
  Path to the trained model directory you want to create renderings for.
  #### --skip_train
  Flag to skip rendering the training set.
  #### --skip_test
  Flag to skip rendering the test set.
  #### --quiet 
  Flag to omit any text written to standard out pipe. 

  **The below parameters will be read automatically from the model path, based on what was used for training. However, you may override them by providing them explicitly on the command line.** 

  #### --source_path / -s
  Path to the source directory containing a COLMAP or Synthetic NeRF data set.
  #### --images / -i
  Alternative subdirectory for COLMAP images (```images``` by default).
  #### --eval
  Add this flag to use a MipNeRF360-style training/test split for evaluation.
  #### --resolution / -r
  Changes the resolution of the loaded images before training. If provided ```1, 2, 4``` or ```8```, uses original, 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 resolution, respectively. For all other values, rescales the width to the given number while maintaining image aspect. ```1``` by default.
  #### --white_background / -w
  Add this flag to use white background instead of black (default), e.g., for evaluation of NeRF Synthetic dataset.
  #### --convert_SHs_python
  Flag to make pipeline render with computed SHs from PyTorch instead of ours.
  #### --convert_cov3D_python
  Flag to make pipeline render with computed 3D covariance from PyTorch instead of ours.

We further provide the ```full_eval.py``` script. This script specifies the routine used in our evaluation and demonstrates the use of some additional parameters, e.g., ```--images (-i)``` to define alternative image directories within COLMAP data sets. If you have downloaded and extracted all the training data, you can run it like this:
```shell
python full_eval.py -m360 <mipnerf360 folder> -tat <tanks and temples folder> -db <deep blending folder>
```
